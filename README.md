# Gif-Tastic-Repo

This gif search site has a sports theme that allows visitors to view existing gifs by selecting one of the buttons displayed. When a button is selected the viewer is given 10 gifs that are still but when clicked begin their full animation. When the gif is clicked again the animation stops. Viewers are also given the option to add new buttons by adding another sport topic in the search form. After hitting the search button a new sport topic button is displayed in the buttons area. When the viewer clicks the button a new set of gifs appear.
